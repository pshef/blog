I've always poked at computers. When I was a little kid, a family friend was throwing away an old computer and we took it home, and I took the whole thing apart. I couldn't figure out how to put it back together, but I wanted to make a ROBOT!!! Of course, I didn't make a robot out of the old tower, and it ended up collecting dust in a box in the basement.

While the hardware stuff was always somewhat interesting, it wasn't enough for me to try and make anything out of it as I grew older. But as I spent more time on the internet, I became extremely interested in privacy and security. I started devoting a lot of time into cleaning up the huge mess I made trying to let Google control my life. (Yes, I was a very early adopter of Google+ and tried to integrate everything I could into my Google account. I've regretted it ever since.)

While my jobs have varied from liquor store clerk to warehouse worker, I've made the committment to make the career change into infosec. This blog will serve as documentation of my journey.
