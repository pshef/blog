It has been a mindnumbingly busy week at work. Here's some of what I did outside of it:
- I got the BHIS zine in and cracked the cipher in their cipher issue. (Side note, I wish they'd put the issue number in there somewhere.) I managed to get into the CTF website, but didn't try out the challenges in there yet.
- I've decided that Go is going to be the programming language for me. From what I've seen between it and Python,  I'm liking Go more so far. I won't completely abandon Python since that will still be useful, but I like the idea of a compiled language. I've started some courses on Udemy to get up and running. Plus seeing all the tools by people like [Tomnomnom](https://github.com/tomnomnom) and [Project Discovery](https://github.com/projectdiscovery) is inspiring me.
	- On a related note, I also found the podcast [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime) that's been fun to listen to.
	- From now on, every time you read my blogs and there's a word with "go" in it I need you to know that yes, I did chuckle when I typed it.
- I got a few books this week: ["Hacker Methodology Handbook" by Thomas Bobeck](https://bookshop.org/books/hacker-methodology-handbook/9781731258380), ["Red Team Field Manual" by Ben Clark](https://bookshop.org/books/rtfm-red-team-field-manual/9781494295509), ["Bug Bounty Bootcamp" by Vickie Li](https://bookshop.org/books/bug-bounty-bootcamp-the-guide-to-finding-and-reporting-web-vulnerabilities/9781718501546), and then preorders of ["The Art of Clean Code" by Christian Mayer](https://nostarch.com/art-clean-code) and ["JavaScript Crash Course" by Nick Morgan](https://nostarch.com/javascript-crash-course).
- Watched some more SC-900 and Net+ videos.
- Started watching the web hacking course on ITPro.TV.
- Redeemed my free certification voucher promo with eLearnSecurity, so within the next year I will be taking the eJPT! While I still firmly believe that I have not mastered the fundamentals enough to say that I'm good enough for it yet, I will be still studying for things like Net+, Security+, and the Portswigger Web Testing Academy.
	- I'm toying with the idea of having a blog series about the pentesting side of the eJPT course, where I create really crappy tools in Bash, Go, and Python to help go through the course (yes that's a pun, it's okay to roll your eyes). 
	- I confirmed with INE via email that they are still having the course be accessed through VPN instead of their in-browser labs like the course has switched (Q: "I just had a quick question regarding how the eJPT is accessed. I know in the past it was done via a VPN connection, but many of your labs are switching to the in-browser desktop. Are there plans to convert the eJPT to a similar form as well?" A: "No, at this time, there are no plans to change the exams."). While I appreciate INE trying to make their courses and labs as accessible as possible, I do also prefer using a VPN as opposed to an in-browser connection (this is the same for me even with Try Hack Me and Hack The Box). Knowing that there aren't plans to change this does make me feel like I don't need to rush to take the exam, as opposed to if they were changing I'd feel like I needed to take it before that change took place. End rant.
