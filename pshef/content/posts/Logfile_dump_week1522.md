Really not feeling this post this week. Still dealing with pretty bad food poisoning that started Friday evening, so all of the time I had to do projects kinda fell to the wayside because I didn't have the energy.

I did try to get the sweet combo of RITA/Zeek/MongoDB/Bettercap up and running on my raspberry pi again. I got Bettercap running which was the hurdle I had last time I tried, but now it seems that my RITA installation ain't feeling it. On top of that, when I turned the arp spoofing on via Bettercap, it crashed the entire network at my house which resulted in an unhappy partner watching TV, so I didn't get a chance to really mess around with that further.

Other than that, I made it to season two of Mr. Robot for the first time. So that's cool I guess?
