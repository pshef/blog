It's been a couple weeks since I've posted. Not sorry.

I'm getting into the swing of things at my new job. It's going very well, and I'm enjoying it a lot. Currently I'm focusing mostly on just dealing with tickets and alerts while familiarizing myself with the environment. 

I've also continuted going through various Try Hack Me rooms, and am taking a course on Active Directory which will eventually lead to helping prepare for the eJPT and PNPT.

Not a whole lot else going on right now. Peace.
