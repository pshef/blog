## Sunday 02/06
- Listened to [Black Hills 02/04 podcast episode](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/talkin-about-infosec-news-2-4-2022/)
- Worked on website layout more so that blog posts will be at the top instead of my crappy `About me` post.
    - Also added links to find me at the top.

## Monday 02/07
- Began watching the Microsoft MS-900 course from ITPro.TV. This will be the first Microsoft-specific course (as opposed to the totally-not-a-Microsoft course that A+ is) that I watch, and I'll eventually go through a few others from Microsoft. I will probably not be taking any of the exams, but I know a lot of companies use Microsoft as their backbone so I know it will be useful.

## Tuesday 02/08
- Continued the MS-900 videos.

## Wednesday 02/09
- Published my [blog post](https://pshef.work/posts/a+-review/) about my A+ experience.
- More MS-900 videos!

## Thursday 02/10
- I'm *somewhat* new to scripting so I found a interesting [https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/intro-bash-shell-scripting](blog series from Linode), and I wanted to incorporate some of that into my `deploy.sh(it)` script.

## Friday 02/11
- Rewrote the `deploy.sh(it)` script. I wanted to allow for changes to the blog repository without necessarily updating the website, and also allow for the ability to use different commit messages for each repo. I also didn't like having to run the script with the commit message at the same time (e.g. `$ ./deploy.sh {message}`) and wanted to have the script prompt for messages.
- Minor cosmetic changes for the website (updated favicons).
- Did I mention yet that I'm watching MS-900 videos?

## Saturday 02/12
- FINISHED THE MS-900 VIDEOS!!!
    - Okay, I may have skipped the sections on pricing and licensing, but whatever.
- Started watching the Mike Meyers Udemy videos on the Network+ n10-008. So far it's a lot of reviewed material from the A+, so I guess that's nice.
