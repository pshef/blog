## Sunday 02/27
- Bought a new monitor! [The Samsung 27" T350](https://www.newegg.com/samsung-lf27t350fhnxza-27-full-hd/p/N82E16824022904?Description=samsung%2027%22). First time having multiple monitors. Wrong product, still happy, not going to complain. (Best Buy had it labeled wrong, but I'm not bitter about it. I'M NOT BITTER ABOUT IT.)

## Monday - Thursday 02/28-03/03
- Went through the Antisyphon Training's [SOC Skills class](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/soc-core-skills-w-john-strand/). Will do a review on it once I re-watch the videos in the coming couple of weeks.

## Friday 03/04
- Worked on my FIDO2 mini project.

## Saturday 03/05
- Published my [FIDO2 blog](https://pshef.github.io/posts/fido2_as_login/).
- Set up an internal network in Virtualbox to allow my Kali VM to be connected to the internet and have Vulnhub machines firewalled off. I used [this blog series](https://benheater.com/building-a-security-lab-in-virtualbox/) as a guide.
